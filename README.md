# EasyVisa---Optimization-of-the-visa-approval-process

Developed a predictive model to optimize the visa approval process by analyzing applicant data and identifying key factors influencing decisions. The model provided actionable insights to streamline approvals and improve decision-making efficiency.  

Key Contributions:  
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing** to ensure data quality and model readiness.  
- Implemented advanced classification techniques, including Bagging (Random Forest), Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), and Stacking for ensemble learning.  
- Enhanced model performance through Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV.  
- Applied text Mining to extract meaningful insights from unstructured data.  
- Delivered a scalable and efficient model, reducing processing inefficiencies and improving visa approval predictions.
